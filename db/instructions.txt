1. Install docker desktop + docker-compose CLI
2. Run the following command:

docker-compose up -d

This will create one container, a persistent volume for the database service, install postgres image, and expose
the database services in different ports.

 DEALERSHIP SERVICE'S DATABASE
    Name: dealership
    Container name: dealership
    Exposed port: 5432
    API User: root
    API Password: root

3. Connect to dealership database using the previous credentials through your favorite SQL client.
